# Rails Template

Rails 6 template built with `Docker` and `docker-compose` to **_plug and play_**.

## Requirements

The requirements for this template are simple:

* `Docker`
* `Docker Compose`

## Plug and Play

This repo comes with a `docker-compose.yml` file to handle using a `postgres` image pulled from the web and to use a `.env` file for environmental variables. As such, `compose` requires a `.env` file to function, so run:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

After that, configure the `.env` file as you please and `compose` is now ready to be used.

To get `on rails` quickly, build the image:

```sh
docker-compose build
```

Then, create the database:

```sh
docker-compose run web rails db:create
```

Finally, start the server:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

From now on, every command regarding the app that should be run as `[COMMAND]` will now be run as `docker-compose run web [COMMAND]`. This includes database migrations (`docker-compose run web rails db:migrate`).

## Docker Image

The image generated by `docker-compose build` with the original repo has a size of just `~162MB`, and contains a standard Rails 6 app using `postgresql` as the database, `sass` as the stylesheet pre-processor and `puma` as the webserver.
